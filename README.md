CommunityResourcePack
=====================

Repo for The KSP Community Resource Pack

The GameData folder will include the entire pack.  If you just want the configs, feel free to delete the Karbonite and/or MKS subfolders in your distro.

MKS pack includes:
- Planetary Ore, Substrate, Aquifer, and Minerals

Karbonite pack includes:
- Planetary Karbonite
- Oceanic Karbonite
- Atmospheric Karbonite

Modders - be sure to NOT change directories and whatnot.  Also included are configs for ATM support and TextureReplacer.

NOTE: The KSPI pack is still included with KSPI Experimentals as that is still under development at this time.
